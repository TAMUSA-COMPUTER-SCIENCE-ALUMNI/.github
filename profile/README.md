# Texas A&M University Computer Science Alumni

###### Congratulations on becoming a Texas A&M University-San Antonio Computer Science graduate!
###### TAMUSA has been producing CS Graduates for the last 9 years and you are now in an exclusive club joining the 61 alumni who have graduated before you.
###### We recently began developing an Alumni network with hopes of improving your career outlook, and the career outlook of future TAMUSA CS graduates. We established an Alumni Advisory Committee which works with the Department of Computing and Cyber Security. Our purpose is to advise them on courses and curriculum, and we have had some early successes such as getting the Calculus 2 prerequisite removed from the Algorithms course. We also started a new mentoring program this semester. The program links working Alumni in software engineering or data science positions as mentors to first year students. We are hopeful that this program will boost retention within the major, help young students understand what their degree is about, and help them to know what options are available to them upon graduation.
###### Other initiatives we are attempting to pursue include working with the President's Office to increase the size of the Department's faculty, creating a podcast series of workshops to boost knowledge in both Java and other technologies for both students and Alumni, and assisting with the Department's ABET accreditation.
###### We want to express congratulations to those who have secured a software engineering or data scientist position!
###### For those who are still looking, we have plenty of Alumni available to assist you with your resume and technical interviewing skills. We would challenge each of you to apply for this summer's CodePath Interview Prep Course. This course provides insight into your resume, boosts your coding skills to a new level, and offers a Virtual Career Fair to all who complete the course. The Virtual Career Fair boasted a 51% job offer rate for the ~1,450 students who completed the course last year!
###### The entire Alumni network would love to hear about the great stuff you have been up to! Please reach out to us and tell us about your wins!
###### As we move forward, we are always looking for more volunteers to help make our Alma Mater's program into one that we can all be proud of, which includes jobs for everyone! 
###### If you are interested in getting involved, reach out to us via our LinkedIn page (which you have all been invited to) or through the TAMUSA Computer Science Discord server.
###### Once again congratulations again on your incredible milestone!
